# QKD Demonstrator

These 3D print files (see Releases for STLs) describe a tool that can be used to teach how QKD, in particular BB84 works.

A qubit as used in BB84 is represented by one printout and one marble (roughly 1.5 cm in diameter).
The first party prepares the qubit by putting the marble in one of the four possible options while the middle part is rotated in such a way that the marbles don't directly fall out.
The lid is then placed on and the qubit is sent to the second party. The lid may not be opened until the qubit is *measured*.
Measuring a qubit is achieved by twisting the middle part, clockwise for a standard basis measurement and counterclockwise for a Hadamard basis measurement.
The marble then comes out of either hole at the bottom, indicating the measurement outcome.

Note: This is of course an imperfect representation since we only use classical correlation, but it can be used to communicate the basic concept.

The current version is quite big, which is nice for demonstrations, but does use quite some filament.
Scaled down versions should work the same.

The tolerance chosen for the current releases are fairly lose and the quality might benefit from lowering it slightly.
